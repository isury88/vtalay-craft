# Genesis

Genesis is a front-end development starter kit. It provides a starting point for working with HTML, Sass and JavaScript.

Out of the box, Genesis offers:

- a sensible folder structure for organising your project's files
- the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) front-end framework, easily configurable so you can include only the components you need
- a modular JavaScript structure
- a [Nunjucks-based](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) HTML templating system
- a Gulpfile to take care of common tasks such as compiling Sass, combining/minifying JavaScript and processing SVGs

## Quick start

1. Open you terminal at `{your-project-directory}`
2. Run the following command:

```
git clone git@github.com:jamesforddesign/genesis.git genesis_tmp && mv genesis_tmp/front-end front-end && rm -rf genesis_tmp && cd front-end
```

1. Genesis will be cloned into a `front-end` directory. You will then be moved to that directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

You are now ready to start working on your project!
